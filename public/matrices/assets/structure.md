#### Brief Introduction

The study includes a brief introduction covering:

- An explanation of adjacency matrices and the interaction techniques implemented to support task completion
- A description of the dataset you will work with
- Details about the encoding technique you will use during the tasks

#### Training

Since you may not be familiar with adjacency matrices, a short training session with simple tasks has been prepared. This training will help you become comfortable with the encoding technique before beginning the main tasks.

#### Tasks

The study contains 9 tasks about 1 data set as well as a short follow-up survey.
It will take approximately ??? minutes to finish this test.
For each question, you will be given a prompt with an interactive adjacency matrix.
Depending on the task you will be asked to answer by selecting items on the matrix or questions bellow the prompt. Don't worry we will cover this in more detail on the training.
The next button will be available once you set an answer to each task on the left sidebar.
