# FIRST KEY CONCEPT: Mean and Variation.

In this study, we want to show two important things about flight prices in the U.S:

- What is the **mean price** of a flight between two states.
- How stable are this prices, so we want to measure their **variation**.

### Mean

The **mean** is very simple: it’s just the **usual price** you would expect.

Imagine you took several flights between California and Texas.
One flight cost $100, another $120, another $80.
If you add them up and divide by how many flights you had, you get the mean — **the "typical" price.**

But wait — not every flight costs exactly the same! Not every route has the same prices even thought the mean concides!

### Variation

Flights don’t always stick to that average. Sometimes they’re cheaper, sometimes more expensive. We call this how much prices vary around the mean.

**Low variation:** Prices are similar and stable.

**High variation:** Prices jump all over the place — sometimes cheap, sometimes expensive.

We measure those variations using a stat called “standard deviation,” but no worries—you don’t need to remember the math. Just know that pairing the mean with the variation tells you the approximate range where flight prices tend to fall.

##### Example:

Suppose: This 2 routes. California - Nevada (mean price: $100, variation: $50) and New York - Pennsylvania (mean price: $100, variation: $5). Even thought both routes have the same mean, flight prices behave differently:

- California - Nevada: **variation is high**, some flights cost **$50, some $100, some $150!**
- New York - Pennsylvania: **variation is low**, most flights cost something like **$95, $100, $105.**

So even if two pairs of states have the **same average price**, one might be very **predictable** and the other very **unpredictable.**
