_Title of Research Study: Mean & Standard Deviation Encoding in Adjacency Matrices_

# Consent and Authorization Document

You are invited to participate in a research study. Please read this consent form carefully, along with the provided summary. Take the time to ask any questions you may have and ensure you fully understand the study before deciding whether to participate.

#### Purpose of the Study

While network data is increasingly common, the visualization of multi-attribute networks remains underexplored. This study assesses the effectiveness of an encoding technique for visualizing the mean and standard deviation of links in adjacency matrices.

#### Brief Introduction

The study includes a brief introduction covering:

- An explanation of adjacency matrices and the interaction techniques implemented to support task completion
- A description of the dataset you will work with
- Details about the encoding technique you will use during the tasks

#### Training

Since you may not be familiar with adjacency matrices, a short training session with simple tasks has been prepared. This training will help you become comfortable with the encoding technique before beginning the main tasks.

#### Tasks

The study contains 9 tasks about 1 data set as well as a short follow-up survey.
It will take approximately ??? minutes to finish this test.
For each question, you will be given a prompt with an interactive adjacency matrix.
Depending on the task you will be asked to answer by selecting items on the matrix or questions bellow the prompt. Don't worry we will cover this in more detail on the training.
The next button will be available once you set an answer to each task on the left sidebar.

#### Risks to study participants

Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you.

#### Benefits to research participants and others

There may be no direct benefit to reserach participants.
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future data exploration platforms.

#### Record keeping and confidentiality

Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the University of Utah Institutional
Review Board (IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
identify you.
The data collected in this study is only being used for the present study and not for future research.

#### Cost/Payment

You will be compensated $??? for participating via Prolific.
