## Mean as color, Standard deviation as mark size

In the matrix you will use, we made it easier to understand flight prices by using both color and shape at the same time.

##### Color encodes the mean (average price):

Each cell in the matrix will have a color:

- If the color is light, it means the average flight price is low (cheaper flights).
- If the color is dark, it means the average flight price is high (more expensive flights).

So, lighter = cheaper and darker = more expensive.

As you might notice we have divided prices into color categories.

##### Size encodes the standard deviation.

Inside each cell, there will be a white square mark:

- A tiny mark means prices are very stable (they don't change much).
- A big mark means prices are all over the place (they change a lot!).

So, small mark = consistent prices, big mark = unpredictable prices.

As you might notice we have divided price variations into mark sizes categories.
